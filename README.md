Git and GitHub are not the same...

Git is the most commonly used version control system (VCS). Git tracks the changes you made to the files, so you have a record of what changes you made, and you can revert to specific versions whenever you need it.

GitHub is a website that manages projects that use git. You do not need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git. There are many other alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab, BitBucket etc.
Git is software that works locally, your files and the revision history are stored on your computer. You can also use Github online hosts to store a copy of the files and their revision history.

Git also makes collaboration easier with multiple people, where you can upload your changes and download changes from others from a centrally located place.

This article mainly focuses on the basic SHELL commands & GitHub as the hosting service for Git.
